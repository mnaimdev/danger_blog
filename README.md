# Danger Blog

This is a blog application. First I create a design for it and then create a dashboard and integrate it with design. I have created various logics in my backend and added various functionalities to make the blog application work properly. I used Laravel framework of PHP for development and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for design.By doing this project I have understood many complex aspects of backend development and have been able to apply them in practice. I think my coding skills have improved a lot through this and I hope to develop better applications in the future.
